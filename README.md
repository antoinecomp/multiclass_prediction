# multiclass_prediction on loans

420,000 loans with data such as applicant annual income, loan term, state of residence, credit score range and a number of other credit data, etc. The dataset also contains a letter grade classification of the loan in the range A — G. We’re going to use AWS machine learning to build two models, one that will predict an appropriate interest rate and a second that will infer the letter grade for the loan application.

I'm stuck when I want to do the multi-class prediction.
